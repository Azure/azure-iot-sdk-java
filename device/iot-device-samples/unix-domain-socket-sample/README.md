# Unix Domain Socket Implementation Sample

This sample code demonstrates one possible implementation of the [UnixDomainSocketChannel][unix-domain-socket-channel-interface] interface defined by this SDK.

This implementation uses [JNR Unixsocket][jnr-unixsocket-github], but there are other available libraries that provide
unix domain socket capabilities.

[unix-domain-socket-channel-interface]: ./../../iot-device-client/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/device/hsm/UnixDomainSocketChannel.java
[jnr-unixsocket-github]: https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket
