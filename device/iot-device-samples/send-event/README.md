# Send Event Sample

Sample application that uses the Azure IoT Java SDK to send telemetry messages to the
Azure IoT Hub cloud service or to an Azure IoT Edge device. The sample demonstrates how to connect
and send messages using a protocol of your choices as a parameter.

## Build the sample

```
$> cd {sample root}
$> mvn install -DskipTests
```

## Run the sample

Listed below is the command to launch the sample along with a description of its arguments

```
$> cd {sample root}/send-event
$> java -jar target/send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" {number of messages to send} {protocol}  {path to trusted root ca}
```

### Arguments Description

* Connection String:
  * IoT Hub connection string format:

    ```
    HostName=your-hub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=yourDevice;SharedAccessKey=XXXYYYZZZ=;
    ```

  * IoT Edge connection string:

    ```
    HostName=your-hub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=yourDevice;SharedAccessKey=XXXYYYZZZ=;GatewayHostName=mygateway.contoso.com
    ```

* Number of messages - Expressed in decimal
* Protocol - Choices are "mqtt", "https", "amqps", "amqps_ws", "mqtt_ws"
* Path to trusted CA certificate: This is optional for IoT Hub since it's certificate is signed by public root CA. For the Edge Hub, if the CA is not a public root, a path tp the root CA certificate in PEM format is absolutely required. This is required even if the root certificate is installed in the trusted certificate store of the OS.

Sample command invocation:

```
$> java -jar target/send-event-1.14.0-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" 20 mqtt /home/user/ca_cert.pem
```
