/**
 * A client for creating multiplexed connections to IoT Hub. A multiplexed connection allows for multiple device clients
 * to communicate to the service through a single AMQPS connection.
 * <p>
 * A given AMQPS connection requires a TLS connection, so multiplexing may be worthwhile if you want to limit the number
 * of TLS connections needed to connect multiple device clients to IoT Hub.
 * <p>
 * A given multiplexing client also has a fixed amount of worker threads regardless of how many device clients are
 * being multiplexed. Comparatively, every non-multiplexed device client instance has its own set of worker
 * threads. Multiplexing may be worthwhile if you want fewer worker threads.
 * <p>
 * Only AMQPS and AMQPS_WS support multiplexing, and only symmetric key authenticated devices can be multiplexed.
 * <p>
 * {@link ModuleClient} instances cannot be multiplexed.
