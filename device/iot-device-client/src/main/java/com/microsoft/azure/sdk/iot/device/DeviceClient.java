/**
 * <p>
 * The public-facing API. Allows a single logical or physical device to connect
 * to an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub client supports sending events to and receiving
 * messages from an IoT Hub.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To support these workflows, the client library will provide the following
 * abstractions: a message, with its payload and associated properties; and a
 * client, which sends and receives messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The client buffers messages while the network is down, and re-sends them when
 * the network comes back online. It also batches messages to improve
 * communication efficiency (HTTPS only).
 * </p>
 * The client supports HTTPS 1.1 and AMQPS 1.0 transports.

     *	      in case of MQTT and AMQP protocols, this option specifies the interval in milliseconds
     *	      between spawning a thread that dequeues a message from the SDK's queue of received messages.

     *	    - <b>SetCertificatePath</b> - this option is applicable only
     *	      when the transport configured with this client is AMQP. This
     *	      option specifies the path to the certificate used to verify peer.
     *	      The value is expected to be of type {@code String}.
     *
     *      - <b>SetSASTokenExpiryTime</b> - this option is applicable for HTTP/
     *         AMQP/MQTT. This option specifies the interval in seconds after which
     *         SASToken expires. If the transport is already open then setting this
