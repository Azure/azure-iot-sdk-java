## Examples

You can familiarize yourself with different APIs using [samples for DigitalTwinClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/tree/master/service/iot-service-samples/digitaltwin-service-samples).

## Source code folder structure

### /authentication

The code for generating shared access signature tokens, used for authentication Http requests against Azure IoT Hub service.

### /generated

The code generated by autorest using the swagger file defined under [DigitalTwin.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/blob/master/service/iot-service-client/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/service/digitaltwin/swagger/digitalTwin.json).

### /src/Customized

The customzied code written to override the following behavior of auto-generated code:

- Rename some of the generated types, eg. [DigitalTwinGetHeaders](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/blob/master/service/iot-service-client/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/service/digitaltwin/customized/DigitalTwinGetHeaders.java)

### /src/models

Model classes useful for use with the Digital Twin client operations.

### /src/serialization

Serialization helpers provided to help serialize/deserialize commonly used types when working with digital twins.

## Protocol layer generation:
- Go in folder ./swagger and run the powershell script [generateCode.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/blob/master/service/iot-service-client/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/service/digitaltwin/swagger/generate.ps1). It will pick up the [autorest config](./swagger/readme.md) and output the results into [generated](./generated) folder. It will also make a few automated changes to the generated protocol layer, that are required for this client library.

## Troubleshooting

All service operations will throw RestException on failure reported by the service, with helpful error codes and other information.

```java
try
{
    ServiceResponseWithHeaders<DigitalTwinCommandResponse, DigitalTwinInvokeCommandHeaders> commandResponse = client.invokeCommandWithResponse(digitalTwinid, commandName, commandInput, options);
}
catch (RestException ex)
{
    if (ex.response().code() == 404)
    {
        System.out.println("404");
    }
    else
    {
        throw ex;
    }
}
```
