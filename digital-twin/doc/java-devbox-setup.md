# Prepare your development environment

This document describes how to prepare your development environment to use the *Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Java*.

* [Java JDK SE](#installjava)
* [Maven 3](#installmaven)

## Install Java JDK SE
To use the SDK and run the samples you will need **Java SE 7**.

### Windows
For downloads and installation instructions go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable).

#### Set up environment variables
* Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the `jdk1.7.x\bin` directory. (Example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_60\\bin)
* Please make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable includes the full path to the `jdk1.7.x` directory. (Example: JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_60)

You can change your environment variables by going to windows->view advanced system settings->environment variables

You can test whether your `PATH` variable is set correctly by restarting your console and running `java -version`.

### Linux
**Note:** If you are running a version of Ubuntu below 14.10, you must run the command shown below to add the repository that contains the **openjdk-7-jdk** package to Ubuntu's list of software sources before you attempt to use the **apt-get** command to install openjdk-7-jdk:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
```
On Linux, the Java OpenJDK 7 can be installed as follows:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
```

#### Set up environment variables
* Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the bin folder containing java.
```
which java
echo $PATH
```
Ensure that the bin directory shown by the ```which java``` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable.
If it does not:
```
export PATH=/path/to/java/bin:$PATH
```

* Please make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable includes the full path to the jdk.
```
update-alternatives --config java
```
Take note of the jdk location. ```update-alternatives``` will show something similar to ***/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java***. The jdk directory would then be ***/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/***.

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

## Install Maven
Using **_Maven 3_** is the recommended way to install **Azure IoT SDKs for Java**.

### on Windows
For downloads and installation instructions go here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

**Set up environment variables**: make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the `apache-maven-3.x.x\bin` directory. (Example: F:\\Setups\\apache-maven-3.3.3\\bin). The `apache-maven-3.x.x` directory is where Maven 3 is installed.
You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run **_Maven 3_** have been set correctly by restarting your console and running `mvn --version`.

### on Linux
In a shell, type the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install maven
```
**Set up environment variables**: ensure the `PATH` environment variable contains the full path to the bin folder containing **_Maven 3_**.
```
which mvn
echo $PATH
```
Ensure that the bin directory shown by the ```which mvn``` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable.
If it does not:
```
export PATH=/path/to/mvn/bin:$PATH
```
You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run **_Maven 3_** have been set correctly by running
```
mvn --version
```
